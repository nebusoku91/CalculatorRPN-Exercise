//***---Grouping classes into folders---***

//Grouping related classes into folders can be beneficial for organizing and maintaining your 
//codebase. It helps create a logical structure and makes it easier to locate and navigate 
//through the code. Here's a suggestion for structuring your classes into folders:

//Create a folder named "Models" or "Data" and place NumberStack.cs inside it. 
//This folder can contain classes related to data structures or models used in your application.

//Create a folder named "Controllers" and place CalculatorController.cs inside it. 
//This folder can contain classes responsible for controlling the flow and coordination of 
//the calculator functionality.

//Create a folder named "Views" or "UI" and place UserInterface.cs inside it. 
//This folder can contain classes responsible for handling user interface-related operations.

//Create a folder named "Services" and place Calculator.cs inside it. 
//This folder can contain classes that provide the core logic and services for the RPN calculator.

//Leave Program.cs at the root level of your project, as it serves as the entry point of 
//your application.

//By grouping your classes into folders based on their functionality and responsibilities,
//you create a clear and organized structure that enhances readability and maintainability. 
//Additionally, it allows for easier navigation and promotes the separation of concerns,
//making it easier to work on individual components of your application.
